# Deployment Instructions for the Backend Application

This document outlines the steps required to deploy the backend of the MERN stack application.

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your server.
2. **MongoDB Atlas**: Set up a MongoDB Atlas account and create a cluster.
3. **Process Manager**: Install a process manager like PM2 to manage the application.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your server:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mern-deployment-app/backend
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the backend directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the values with your configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Make sure to set the following variables in your `.env` file:

- `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string.
- `PORT`: The port on which your server will run (default is 5000).
- Any other necessary environment variables.

## Step 4: Start the Database Connection

Ensure that your MongoDB Atlas cluster is running and accessible. You may need to whitelist your server's IP address in the MongoDB Atlas security settings.

## Step 5: Start the Application

You can start the application using PM2 for better process management:

```bash
pm2 start src/server.js --name mern-backend
```

To ensure the application restarts on server reboots, use:

```bash
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

## Step 6: Set Up HTTPS (Optional)

For production environments, it is recommended to set up HTTPS. You can use services like Let's Encrypt to obtain an SSL certificate.

## Step 7: Monitor the Application

Set up monitoring for your application using tools like PM2's built-in monitoring or external services like Sentry for error tracking.

## Step 8: Continuous Deployment (Optional)

To set up continuous deployment, configure your CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy changes from your GitHub repository to your server.

## Conclusion

Your backend application should now be deployed and accessible. Make sure to test the endpoints to verify that everything is functioning as expected.
